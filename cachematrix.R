## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a matric 
## and cache's its mean.

## The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the value of the inverse of the matrix


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
          x <<- y
          i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the 
## above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates 
## the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if (!is.null(i)) {
          message("getting cached data")
          return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
